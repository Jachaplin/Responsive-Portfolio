						Hello and welcome to my basic bio! I'm originally from Manhattan Beach, CA but I was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. Ever since I was a kid, I had a stong passion for music. I started playing guitar in middle school and eventually moved back to SoCal to attend Musician's Institute in Hollywood. After my studies at MI, I moved back to the Bay Area to study Recording Arts at Foothill College. 
					</p>
					
				
					<p>
						While establishing myself as a performing musician and audio engineer, I worked as a server in multiple restaurants including P.F. Changs and 5A5 Steak Lounge. Currently, I'm studing web development at UC Berkeley's Extention Bootcamp Program with the goal of transitioning into a full time web development career.
